File Descriptions
-----------------

quick_wallet_query.py
  Best for: Quick checks, daily monitoring
  Output: Simple table of top wallets
  Speed: Very fast (1-2 seconds)
  Use when: You want a quick overview

find_high_potential_wallets.py
  Best for: In-depth analysis
  Output: 3 different rankings (high-potential, consistent winners, early entry)
  Speed: Fast (3-5 seconds)
  Use when: You want comprehensive analysis

advanced_wallet_filter.py
  Best for: Finding specific types of wallets
  Output: Filtered list based on your criteria
  Speed: Fast (2-4 seconds)
  Features: CSV export, many filter options
  Use when: You have specific requirements

monitor_wallets.py
  Best for: Real-time tracking
  Output: Live stream of new trades
  Speed: Continuous (checks every 30s)
  Use when: You want to catch trades as they happen

Data Source
-----------
All scripts read from the wallet_profiles PostgreSQL table, which is automatically
populated by the create_profiles.py job running in the scheduler.

The data shows:
- Which wallets are buying SOL
- When they bought (timestamp and position in price cycle)
- What happened after they bought (cycle peak, potential gains)
- Trade sizes

Key Metrics
-----------
Trades:    Number of buy transactions
Avg%:      Average potential gain (entry to cycle peak)
Win%:      Percentage of profitable trades (>0.5% gain)
Entry%:    Average timing in cycle (0%=start, 100%=end)
Score:     Combined metric (trades × avg% × win%)
AvgSize:   Average trade size in USD

Typical Values
--------------
Trades:     5+ for significance, 20+ for strong signal
Avg%:       1-2% typical, 3%+ excellent
Win%:       50% average, 70%+ very good
Entry%:     30% or less is early entry
Score:      Higher is better (no fixed scale)

Performance Tips
----------------
1. Use 24h lookback for recent activity
2. Require min 5-10 trades for statistical validity
3. Look for consistency (high win rate) over lucky streaks (one big win)
4. Early entry (low Entry%) usually correlates with better gains
5. Check recent activity - wallets can change behavior

Common Queries
--------------

"Who are the best traders?"
  python3 quick_wallet_query.py 20

"Show me consistent winners"
  python3 find_high_potential_wallets.py
  (Look at section 2: CONSISTENT WINNERS)

"Find whales (large trades)"
  python3 advanced_wallet_filter.py --min-trade-size 1000

"Find early entry specialists"
  python3 advanced_wallet_filter.py --max-entry-timing 20 --min-gain 1.5

"Track top 10 wallets in real-time"
  python3 monitor_wallets.py --top 10

"Export top 50 to CSV"
  python3 advanced_wallet_filter.py --min-trades 5 --limit 50 --export top50.csv

Troubleshooting
---------------

No results found:
  - Try shorter lookback period (--hours 12)
  - Lower minimum thresholds (--min-trades 3)
  - Check if wallet_profiles table has recent data

Database connection error:
  - Verify PostgreSQL is running
  - Check credentials in /root/follow_the_goat/.env
  - Ensure you're running from project root

Query too slow:
  - Reduce lookback period
  - Add indexes (see SQL_EXAMPLES.txt)
  - Use quick_wallet_query.py instead of complex queries

Integration with Trading System
--------------------------------

Once you've identified high-performing wallets, you can:

1. Add them to follow_the_goat plays
   - Configure plays to prioritize these wallets
   - Set up alerts when they make new trades

2. Create custom patterns
   - Use wallet addresses in pattern definitions
   - Weight trades from these wallets higher

3. Monitor in real-time
   - Use monitor_wallets.py to track their activity
   - Set up notifications for their trades

4. Backtest strategies
   - Export historical data
   - Analyze if following these wallets would be profitable

Further Customization
---------------------

All scripts are Python and can be modified:
1. Open the .py file in a text editor
2. Adjust constants at the top (MIN_BUYS, THRESHOLDS, etc.)
3. Modify SQL queries to change calculations
4. Add new metrics or filters

For SQL experts:
- See SQL_EXAMPLES.txt for query templates
- Connect directly to PostgreSQL for custom analysis
- All data is in the wallet_profiles table
